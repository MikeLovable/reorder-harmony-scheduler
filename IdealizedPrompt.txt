Create a reorder algorithm scheduling application with these features:

1. Implement a TypeScript algorithm that calculates optimal order scheduling for manufacturing parts based on:
   - Production requirements (Rqt)
   - Current inventory levels (Inv)
   - Scheduled receiving (Rec)
   - Manufacturing parameters (MOQ, PkQty, LdTm, InvTgt, SStok)

2. The algorithm should:
   - Calculate optimal order quantities considering lead times and minimums
   - Avoid production halts due to inventory shortages
   - Prevent excessive inventory (>3x target for multiple weeks)
   - Aim to keep inventory close to target + safety stock levels

3. Build a React UI with:
   - A table showing both input scenarios and calculated schedules
   - Color-coding for inventory status (zero, below safety stock, excessive)
   - Visual indication of orders and receiving
   - Clear section headings and organized data display
   - Ability to generate new random data for testing

4. Use shadcn/ui components for a clean, professional interface.

5. Include a legend explaining the color-coding system.

The application should help manufacturing planners visualize and optimize their ordering strategies to maintain ideal inventory levels while meeting production requirements.
